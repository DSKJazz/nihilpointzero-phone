/**
 * Offline shell for the NihilPointZero phone app.
 *
 * Caches only the app's own files so the icon opens instantly and shows a clear
 * message when there is no signal. AI requests are never cached — an answer is
 * always generated fresh, and a stale one would be worse than none.
 *
 * CACHE carries the build stamp, written in by scripts/build-phone.mjs. That is not
 * cosmetic: with a fixed name the previous version's files sit in the cache forever
 * under the same key, and an old app can outlive a publish. A new name means the
 * activate handler below deletes the old one outright.
